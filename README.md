# Dart Reduce Method Error on Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce` method requires at least one element to operate on.  Attempting to use it on an empty list throws a `StateError` exception. This example showcases the issue and provides a solution to handle such cases gracefully.

## Bug Description
The `reduce` method throws a `StateError` when called on an empty list. This can happen when dealing with dynamic data where the list might sometimes be empty.

## Solution
The solution is straightforward. Check if the list is empty before calling `reduce`. If it is empty, handle the case appropriately, perhaps by returning a default value or handling the empty list condition in a different way.
